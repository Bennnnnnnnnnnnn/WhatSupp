# WhatSupp - Development Roadmap & TODOs

## 🎯 Project Overview
WhatSupp is a personalized supplement recommendation platform that uses user surveys to provide tailored supplement stacks based on goals, dietary restrictions, allergies, and current supplement usage, the site does not sell supplements, it uses affiliate links. Also hosts scientific papers to inform users.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)

### Database Setup
- [ ] **Choose Database Technology**
  - [ ] Option A: PostgreSQL + Node.js backend
  - [ ] Option B: Firebase/Firestore for rapid development  
  - [ ] Option C: Supabase for PostgreSQL with built-in APIs

- [ ] **Design Database Schema**
  - [ ] `users` table (profiles, preferences)
  - [ ] `supplements` table (products, ingredients, allergens, categories)
  - [ ] `survey_responses` table (user answers, timestamps)
  - [ ] `recommendations` table (generated stacks, reasoning)
  - [ ] `ingredients` table (individual compounds, allergen flags)
  - [ ] `brand_products` table (actual purchasable products)

- [ ] **Seed Database with Supplement Data**
  - [ ] Research and compile 100+ popular supplements
  - [ ] Map ingredients to allergen categories
  - [ ] Add goal-to-supplement effectiveness ratings
  - [ ] Include pricing data from major retailers

### Backend API Development
- [ ] **Authentication System**
  - [ ] User registration/login
  - [ ] Session management
  - [ ] Password reset functionality

- [ ] **Survey API Endpoints**
  - [ ] `POST /api/survey/submit` - Store survey responses
  - [ ] `GET /api/survey/{userId}` - Retrieve user surveys
  - [ ] `PUT /api/survey/{surveyId}` - Update existing survey

- [ ] **Recommendation Engine API**
  - [ ] `POST /api/recommendations/generate` - Create recommendations
  - [ ] `GET /api/recommendations/{userId}` - Get user's recommendations
  - [ ] `POST /api/recommendations/feedback` - User rating system

## 🧠 Phase 2: Recommendation Algorithm (High Priority)

### Auto-Exclusion Logic
- [ ] **Allergen Filtering**
  - [ ] Create comprehensive allergen-ingredient mapping
  - [ ] Implement hard exclusion for selected allergens
  - [ ] Add severity levels (avoid vs. minimize)

- [ ] **Current Supplement Deduplication** 
  - [ ] Prevent recommending supplements user already takes
  - [ ] Detect ingredient overlaps (e.g. multivitamin contains Vitamin D)
  - [ ] Suggest upgrades/alternatives if current supplement is low quality

- [ ] **Dietary Restriction Compliance**
  - [ ] Vegan/vegetarian filtering
  - [ ] Keto/low-carb compatible options
  - [ ] Halal/kosher certifications

### Intelligent Recommendation Logic
- [ ] **Goal-Based Scoring Algorithm**
  - [ ] Weight supplements by effectiveness for each goal
  - [ ] Consider synergistic combinations (e.g. Creatine + Protein)
  - [ ] Prioritize evidence-based supplements over trendy ones

- [ ] **Budget Optimization**
  - [ ] Sort recommendations by cost-effectiveness
  - [ ] Suggest "essential vs. nice-to-have" tiers
  - [ ] Bundle discounts and bulk pricing

- [ ] **Experience Level Adjustments**
  - [ ] Beginner: Focus on basics (protein, multivitamin, omega-3)
  - [ ] Intermediate: Add goal-specific supplements
  - [ ] Advanced: Include specialized/cutting-edge options

### Survey UX Improvements
- [ ] **Multi-Step Progress**
  - [ ] Break survey into 3-4 steps with progress indicator
  - [ ] Save progress and allow returning later
  - [ ] Smart skip logic based on previous answers

- [ ] **Enhanced Input Methods**
  - [ ] Slider inputs for intensity levels
  - [ ] Visual goal selection (icons/images)
  - [ ] Auto-suggest for current supplements
  - [ ] Barcode scanner for existing products (mobile)
